          365 days but this one is more special.
          <br />
          To the sweetest and most lovely woman. I want you to be so happy and
          successful. And more than that, I want you to feel peace of mind. I
          want you to have all the good things in your life that are beyond your
          expections. I wish your everyday full of happiness and smiles.
